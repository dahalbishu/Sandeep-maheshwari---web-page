<center><h2> SANDEEP MAESHWARI BIOGRAPHY </h2></center>

<p id = "sanbiographya"> <span id ="biohighlight"> Early Age  </span><br><br><br>
Sandeep resides in New Delhi, India. When he was 13 years old, his family thought that he would do with his 
moped(a light two wheeler) that was gifted to him by his father. Little Sandeep would travel and move in Delhi, 
a city with enormous traffic on roads. Therefore, he learned practicality day by day from the real life situations.<br><br>

 Sandeep used to Rent a Moped - Startup Archive

His father was amazed to see that he came up with an idea of making money with his little moped. He rented his scooter 
to his friend which would take his girl to a ride. Within few months, he was known for renting two-wheeler and was earning
 Rs 50($0.8) per hour with a condition that the customer had to bear all the fuel expenses! That is, he was now in a complete
 profit! Yes, don’t be crazy counting the Maintenance expenses. <br><br>

But a few years later, Sandeep’s father had a tough time in his Aluminium business. All the burden and responsibilities were
 now shifted to Sandeep’s head. He knew that this is his time to support his family. His time had come at a meagre age of 19.
 But Mr Maheshwari had a mind of his own and as we all know he tried a number of Businesses and successfully landed at 
 ImagesBazaar. <br><br><br>
 
 <span id ="biohighlight">A Failure – Party Idea Didn’t Work </span><br><br><br>
In 1999, Sandeep got an idea to make money. He with approached by an unknown but kind looking guy. They both decided to do
 something creative and be business partners. They organised a New Year Party Bash. Both of them were connected while the
 preparation was done. Everything went Better than they expected! Sandeep named it ‘DIX 2000’. Everything went awesome.
 They both earned Rs 50,000 ($800) and the plan was to divide the total profit into 2 equal parts.<br><br>

His conscience pricked him that he was not able to find the person who organised the event with him! He
 contacted his Phone, but it was Switched Off. He looked him everywhere but couldn’t find any clue of him. 
 This left him completely baffled. He went to the Party’s Manager and got to know that their ‘Payment‘ for the
 event has been taken by the other event handler. He ran away with the Cash! Poor Maheshwari worked diligently on the event.
 But Maheshwari was cheated and the other ‘kind’ looking person took the bag with money and never contacted Maheshwari.<br><br>

Maheshwari knew that this life event had some importance. He got back home and started dancing thinking that this event
 would lead to something Awesome! He was thrilled that Now this time he had worked hard, maintained his inner Critique and 
 Still got Betrayed! This means that Yes, he is still learning!<br><br><br>
 
  <span id ="biohighlight">Portfolio Company Start Up</span><br><br><br>


 He had a small spark in his mind, he started his career as a model at the age of 19. It was then he noticed the
 harassment and annoying environment that Indian models had to live in. He was moved by this and decided to do something
 about it. Instead of working harder and getting better academic grades, he dropped out of Kirorimal College (nowadays better
 known as Delhi University) in the 3rd year of B.com, to help those struggling models with the environment they had to live
 in.<br><br>

It’s easy to imagine now that this was a Good decision, but looking back then when he had no money in his pocket and was a 
man full of ambitions, dropping out from college seems way more challenging!<br><br><br>

  <span id ="biohighlight">Founding Million Dollar Company – ImagesBazaar </span><br><br><br>


He continued his Entrepreneurial journey and founded Imagesbazaar.com, a stock portfolio company. Because he had a small
 setup, he did multi-tasking. He was the photographer, telephone-caller, counselor etc. The task seemed 
 innumerable. People came and got attached to his company’s culture and professional behavior, that I recall him saying.
