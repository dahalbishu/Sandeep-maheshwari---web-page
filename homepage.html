<p class="head"> Sandeep Maheshwari's Biography</p>
<p> Sandeep Maheshwari is a name among millions who struggled, failed
 and surged ahead in search of success, happiness and contentment. Just like
 any middle class guy, he too had a bunch of unclear dreams and a blurred vision of
 his goals in life. All he had was an undying learning attitude to hold on to. Rowing
 through ups and downs, it was time that taught him the true meaning of his life.

<p class="head"> Sandeep Maheshwari The Motivational Leadership</p>
<p> Motivational leadership refers to someone leading others by motivating them to
 strive for certain goals rather than simply act on orders. The leader tries to
 create a safe and trusting environment, and ensure the organization is positioned 
for success in its domain—for example, a company in the marketplace. Some interpret
 motivational leadership principles as requiring that a leader establish strong ethics
, clear vision, definable values, authentic communication, and
 be genuinely motivated to promote collaboration and a positive working environment.
