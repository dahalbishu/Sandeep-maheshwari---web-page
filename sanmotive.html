<center><h2> Most Inspiring Person in My Life</h2></center>

<p id = "sanbiographya"> 

AS you grow up, you will set up some goals and you start to dream about that. In order to strengthen 
your skills, knowledge, courage, you will follow the person who is most inspiring for your life.
 He is a role model for your career. Whenever you see him and you listen his words, you will get a 
 strong feeling that I can do anything in my life. So he is MOST INSPIRING PERSON IN YOUR LIFE.<br><br>

Well I also have most Inspiring person in my life. I used to see him every day and whenever I
 feel bored or fed up I used listen his words. Whenever I listen his words, I feel that I can do
 anything in my life and I will be very happy. I have never seen such a man in my life. And his life
 story makes me feel strong.<br><br>

Well, how many of us are most successful in our lives? I don’t know others reply but mine will be “Am Not”.
 The Reason behind this, I have not achieved what I want to be. During my childhood days I used to dream a lot, but 
 now I feel feared to dream because as you grow up you will realize the practical world. I want to be a SAP Consultant 
 (Functional) in my life. Becoming a consultant is not an easy job. But if you think so, it will be hard only. So 
 In order to gain confidence and courage to do things, I will always look at him and I would say “I can do anything in my life”.

<b>This person is none other than Sandeep Maheshwari, Founder and CEO of Image bazaar.</b><br><br>



I am inspired by him by his speech and the way he struggled and succeeded in his life. In this competitive
 business world, we have seen few people working to improve others live by their life story and success they
 have attained. He is a true inspiring Indian who attained success in very short span of life.  His thought “Aasaan hai”
 it’s most inspiring. He is the person behind many successful people. He has conducted several seminars, without charging
